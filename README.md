# NASA-API-project
This webpage fetches data from NASA's API and displays the information (from images to explanation, etc).
The webpage loads 12 data at a time. To move to the nextpage, click on "Next Page"
There's a lot of yellow on this webpage because I am very obsessed with the colour yellow.


#Things you can do on the Webpage
1. To like a picture, click on the yellow(ðŸ’›) icon under the title of the data or picture.
2. click on ðŸ’›s on the title bar to view liked data or picture.
3. click on the black(ðŸ–¤) icon currently replacing the yellow(ðŸ’›) icon at the liked page to remove a particular data or picture.
4. click on "Go Back" to go back to the initial page.

#Challenges
This challenge is really a challenge. I could only fetch one picture at a time initially. I tried to loop through the rest of the data but it wasn't working. I worked on this project for nearly a week and finished it few hours before the deadline(Thank God). I eventually realised(after so many days) that I could fetch the data without looping. I wouldn't have finished this project on time without google(Thank you Google). I had many other personal challenges. I also learnt a lot of new things while working on this project. As tasking as it was, it was just simply amazing.
